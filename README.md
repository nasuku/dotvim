dotvim
======

A framework for settinsg up vim using pathogen

Installation
------------

From your homedirectory:

    git --recursive clone git://github.com/dotvim/dotvim.git ~/.vim
    cp .vim/templates/vimrc-example ~/.vimrc

General configuration
---------------------

`,` is used as mapleader
`backslash` is used as localleader

* `,e` mapped to `:e **/`. essentially you do `,efoo<tab>` to get a list of all files starting with foo
* `,s` - toggle invisible characters display
* `,n` - next `quicklist` result (like :Ggrep etc)
* `,N` - previous `quicklist` result (like :Ggrep etc)
* `Ctrl-E` - switch between 2 last buffers  (its just a `:b#<cr>` :)
* `Ctrl-N` to cancel current search highlighing
* `,f` global Ggrep for word under the cursor or for selection
* `+`, `-` - easily inc/decrement integers
* `,W` - remove trailing spaces
* `Ctrl-g`/`h`/`j`/`k` - simplified split panes navigation

Check out the 'plugin/settings/\*.vim' for more...

Backups
-------

Backups and swapfiles are disabled. I really hate them both.

You can re-enable backups by adding the following to your `~/.vimrc`:

    set backup

 and swapfiles by

    set swapfile

backup dir is set to ~/.backup/vim/

The directory is created if it doesn't exist.

Persistent Undo
---------------

Persistent undos are enabled by default.

You can disable by adding the following to your `~/.vimrc`:

    set noundo

### Misc Bindings

The following is a list of commands and key bindings that I personally find interesting
stored for easy refreshing my memory of them. there is no much 'system' to it, just
randomly chosen bits of vim goodness.

* `]p` paste with autoindent.
* `ga` print ascii value of character under the cursor
* `g#` like "#", but without using "\<" and "\>"
* `g<` display previous command output
* `zt` scroll cursor line to top
* `zz` scroll cursor line to center
* `zb` scroll cursor line to bottom
* `CTRL-W x` exchange current window with n-th window (or next if no count given)
* `gv` reselect last selection
* `gt` next tab
* `gT` prev tab
* `ci` change inside delimiters
* `di` delete inside delimiters
* `@@` execute last macro
* `"xyy` copy line into `x` register (replace x with any other)
* `<C-R>x` while in insert mote will paste content of register x (replace x with any other)
* `"xp` paste from register x
* `:reg` Display the contents of all numbered and named registers.
